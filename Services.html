	<i>Riverfront Community Center</i> <br><br>
	<b>Address:</b> 123 S Esplanade St, Leavenworth, KS 66048 <br><br>
	<b>Review:</b> I went to this venue, the Riverfront Community Center, for a wedding this previous year. What I liked about this venue and what they offered to the <br>
	weddings was the beautiful rooms, the space, and the help that accompanied. There were two rooms for ceremonies across from one another, or if you decided to be <br>
	married on a day that church was held in session, it could be done. The sectionizing of the area still allowed ample privacy. There were more than enough chairs, <br>
	so that was not a problem to be faced. The area for the reception was spacious and just across a hall from the ceremony room. The Community Center staff offered <br>
	help with cleaning and setting up. There was a section of dance floor in this room that was tiled as apposed to carpeted. <br><br>
	Overall, I think this is a great place to hold any sort of event. While it was great for a wedding, the reception hall could be for any large party. The added scenery outside of the establishment <br>
	was nice, as well. The river is less than a hundred yards away, where there are river walks and statues. Great for photo opportunities. <br><br><br>
	
	9/10</p>
