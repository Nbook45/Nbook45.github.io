		<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Part One and Two</b> <br><br>
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>About:</b> This story begins years after the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows novel. This story revolves around the battle between<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry's past and the struggle that his children now face. It is full of twists and turns at every page turn. <br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Review:</b> I have to admit, at first, I really didn't want to continue reading this novel. I believe the first time I opened it, I got to  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; the part where Albus convinces his friend to jump from the Hogwart's Express with him and vanish. I put the book down and cast it from what I enjoy. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; This novel was hard for me, where I felt like I'd been with Harry and his gang growing up through the entire series, but then there is this son of <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry's that could treat him this way. It was not in my perfect idolization of Harry Potter books. It did not fit in with the pedestal I put the <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; story behind Harry Potter onto. I very must disliked where this book was going, but I also couldn't quit. I'd given this series way too much, having <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; reread the series more than once growing up. I would recommend you do not put the novel down, as well. You learn a great deal of true struggles in families. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; It is no longer just about magic, it is about what we outside of this fantasy world could potentially go through when you try to fill your Father's shoes, <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; for example. Read on! <br><br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>9/10 (for the heartbreak)</b>
