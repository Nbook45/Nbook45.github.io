		<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets </b> <br><br>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>About:</b> This is the second movie in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. <br><br>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Review:</b> This is both simultaneously a film critique as well as an entertainment critique, where Kansas City <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; conducts live symphonies each year to one of the Harry Potter films. The symphony plays the music to Harry Potter, which there is <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; quite a lot when you pay attention to it, and it is a beautiful experience. I would recommend this type of entertainment any day. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; The music is lovely and played by very skilled artists. This was at the Kaufman stadium, which is pleasant in itself. <br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the movie, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it is about finding out who the heir of Slytherin is, who is petrifying mudbloods, <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; and how will Harry Potter and his friends save the day. While it is not one of my most favorites of the series, it is important in the character <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; building and strengthening of the friendship between the main characters. It plays on the skills of each character and how Harry always seems <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; to find himself where he shouldn't be. <br><br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>9.5/10</b>
